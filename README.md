# Task++

## This was created at Hack the Hammer II 2019

## Inspiration

Going into this event, we wanted to create a tool that could help students with managing their time more effectively. We noticed that there aren't many calendars that offer detailed services to help users manage tasks or deadlines, so we decided to implement our idea into a website application. Additionally, we ensured to make UI minimalistic and easy to navigate.

## What it does

Task++ is a website that allows users to create new detailed tasks or deadlines they want to keep track of. When creating a new task, they can indicate specific subtasks they want to track to better manage the progress of a task. Tasks that users have added can also be sorted by due date and progression status (how many equally weighted subtasks are completed for a certain task, represented by %). The calendar also allows users to view all their tasks for the current month at a glance.

## How we built it

The project was built simply with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The overall website structure was divided into 3 subsections which were: a landing page to greet users upon entering the site, an events page that allows users to create and manage new and existing goals and deadlines, and a calendar page to enable users to view their tasks for the month at a glance.

## Challenges we ran into

- Did not end up implementing calendar
- Was not efficient without the use of framework(s), however, did not know how to use frameworks

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completely dynamic
- Professional appearance

## What we learned

- Good understanding of basic implementation of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a website.

## What's next for Task++

- Voice integration to add new events and tasks verbally
- Cross-platform integration
- Google Calendar integration (if possible)
- Personal, user-specific calendars stored in backend database
